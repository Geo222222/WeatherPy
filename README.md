WeatherPy and VacationPy Project
Background
The true power of data lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. This project aims to utilize Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

While it might seem obvious that it gets hotter as we approach the equator, this project delves deeper into understanding and proving this assertion using data.
